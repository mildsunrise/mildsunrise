Hi, I'm Alba 👋

 - I usually like to work on low-level stuff such as ⚙️ kernels, 🔬 forensics & reverse engineering, 📠 networks and 📡 SDR; sometimes also 🎥 A/V.
 - My favorite languages are Typescript, Python, Haskell, Elm & C++ (a bit).
 - Currently a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) core developer, mostly TLS work there.
 - I'm shy, but I like to meet new people ✨
